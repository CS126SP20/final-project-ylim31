# Documentation for my final project

I want to program and design a game similar to the 1978 arcade game Space Invaders 
where you in a spaceship has to fight against the waves of aliens in a laser battle. 
The objective of the game is to destroy the waves of aliens while dodging their bullets. 
I would love to recreate the classical arcade game that brought joy to many childhoods. 
That being said, many designs and gameplay aspect might be slightly different, but I want 
to use Space Invaders as a reference. Honestly, I'm not a hardcore gamer nor I have a determined 
goal to become a game desinger. However, games are fun and creating somethinig fun is well...fun.
That's why I want to program a game even though it may not be as complicated other games out there. 
It's always a nice feeling to be proud of your completed work. I feel like making a game is something 
I can be proud of because I like games.

I did some searching and I came up with Cinder-WMFVideo and poSpritesheet I want to test it out. Cinder-WMFVideo
is used for the background video of the game. poSpritesheet is used to display sprite of the alien, projectile,
and the player.

I want to separate each weeks to work on specific parts of the game. I want to take the first week to work on
the impleamenting the external libraries. The second week can be functionality of the game.
Third week can be adding interface designs and finish up touchings. However, I expect to spend most of my time on
the functionality aspect so the my first week of work might be dragged into second week. If I have extra time,
I was to add extra functionality to the game that I haven't planned yet. For instance, an option to change skin
of your spaceship.
