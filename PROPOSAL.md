# PROPOSAL

I want to program and design a game similar to the 1978 arcade game Space Invaders 
where you in a spaceship has to fight against the waves of aliens in a laser battle. 
The objective of the game is to destroy the waves of aliens while dodging their bullets. 
I would love to recreate the classical arcade game that brought joy to many childhoods. 
That being said, many designs and gameplay aspect might be slightly different, but I want 
to use Space Invaders as a reference. Games are fun and creating something fun is well...fun.
It's always a nice feeling to be proud of your completed work. I feel like making a game is something 
I can be proud of because I like games.

I will be using cinder block [Cinder-WMFVideo](https://github.com/stimulant/Cinder-WMFVideo) and 
[poSpritesheet](https://github.com/Potion/Cinder-poSpritesheet). Cinder-WMFVideo is used for the
background video of the game. poSpritesheet is used to animate the aliens and nyan cat.


I will be separating each week to work on some specific tasks to complete the game. For week 1, I will
mainly be focused on setting up the project and linking the cinder block libraries. For week 2, I will
start working on the functionality of the game. For week 3, I will work on the interface of the game ie
adding animations, game state, score, etc.
